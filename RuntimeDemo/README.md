# Parameter Passing and Parallelization

This is a fairly contrived example showing the variant ways 
parameters can be passed to method layers. 
In addition, it allows testing the looping implementation of method layers 
against the parallel implementation that tries to use all available processor cores. 

- Unit class `DemoUnit` contains annotated methods that represent all intended cases.
- Class `DemoLayers` establishes the global structure and adds the global dynamics.
