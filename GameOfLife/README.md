# Game of Life

This example implements **_Conway's Game of Life_**. 
It introduces the JLayer Framework and shows the application of the 
JLayer annotations `@LayerUnit`, `@LayerField` and `@LayerMethod`. 
Moreover, it shows how a mathematical relation over indices is used to **connect layers**. 

- Unit Class `LifeCell` is used for coding the game from a cell's point of view.
- Class `LifeUniverse` establishes the global structure and adds the global dynamics.
